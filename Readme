# IPL Match Winner Prediction Using Machine Learning (2026 Prediction Included)

This project is an **AI + Machine Learning based system** that predicts the outcome of IPL matches using historical match data, feature engineering, and ML classification models such as **Random Forest** and **XGBoost**.

The project also calculates the **Team Win Percentage using a corrected formula** and predicts the **most probable winner of IPL 2026** based on historical performance.

## Project Objectives

- Clean and preprocess IPL ball-by-ball + match dataset  
- Perform detailed **EDA** (team performance, toss impact, venue influence, season trends)  
- Encode categorical data and generate new meaningful features  
- Train ML models to predict match winners  
- Calculate **team-wise winning percentages**  
- Predict **IPL 2026 probable winner** based on historical performance

##  Dataset Information

The dataset is a structured IPL match + ball-by-ball dataset with columns like:

- `batting_team`, `bowling_team`, `runs_total`, `team_runs`, `team_wicket`
- `overs`, `balls_per_over`, `venue`, `toss_winner`
- `match_won_by`, `season`, `city`, `event_name`, etc.

After cleaning, unnecessary high-cardinality columns such as umpire names, player names, event names, etc. were removed.

##  Data Cleaning Steps

- Removed IDs and irrelevant columns  
- Dropped rows with missing `match_won_by` values  
- Forward-filled missing values  
- Cleaned unexpected team names and encoded consistent team IDs  

---

## Feature Engineering

Following new meaningful features were created:

- `overs_faced` → team_balls / balls_per_over  
- `current_run_rate` → team_runs / overs_faced  
- `wickets_in_hand` → 10 – team_wicket  
- `is_chasing` → 1 if innings == 2 else 0  

These features helped improve model learning.
